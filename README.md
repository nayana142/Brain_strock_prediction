# Stroke
* A stroke, or brain attack, happens when blood flow to your brain is stopped.The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients in order to work well. If blood supply is stopped even for a short time, this can cause problems. Brain cells begin to die after just a few minutes without blood or oxygen.
* Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. 

* Here are 2 kinds of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic.

   * Ischemic stroke. This is the most common type of stroke. It happens when a major blood vessel in the brain is blocked. It may be blocked by a blood clot. Or it may be blocked by a buildup of fatty deposit and cholesterol. This buildup is called plaque.

   * Hemorrhagic stroke. This occurs when a blood vessel in your brain bursts, spilling blood into nearby tissues. With a hemorrhagic stroke, pressure builds up in the nearby brain tissue. This causes even more damage and irritation.
  
### Risk factors for strok
* The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. 
* Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA(mini-strokes), end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation.
* An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. 
* A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm.

### How can we diagnose
* Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and is supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan.
* A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. 
* Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.# Stroke
